}
\arguments{
\item{combined_first_results}{Data frame of first cancer diagnoses output from 
function(sim_MCED_parallel_universe_before_CRC())}

\item{combined_additional_results}{Data frame of additional (non-first) cancer diagnoses}

\item{starting_age}{Numeric starting age for cohort}

\item{ending_age}{Numeric ending age for simulation}

\item{CRC_data}{Data frame containing colorectal cancer simulation results}

\item{surv_param_table}{Data frame of cancer-specific survival parameters}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: results(A data frame for all individuals after reassignment and
                                  competing-risk processing)
                                  no_match_counter (total number of additional cancers that could
                                  not be reassigned to a no-primary-cancer individual within the same age stratum)
}
\description{
Integrates colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes with MCED simulation results. The function:
(1) filters additional cancers to those clinically diagnosable before other-cause death,
(2) simulates cancer-specific survival for these additional cancers,
(3) reassigns additional cancers to individuals without a primary cancer diagnosis using
    5-year other-cause-death age strata, and
(4) computes competing-risk outcomes (diagnosis ages/events and death ages/events) for
    both screening and no-screening scenarios, including an overdiagnosis indicator.
}
\details{
The reassignment algorithm attempts to match each additional cancer to an individual
 without a primary cancer diagnosis in the same 5-year other-cause-death age stratum.
 If a match is found, the additional cancer is reassigned to that individual; unmatched
 additional cancers increment \code{no_match_counter}.
